To generate the answer for part 1, run the following command:

python part1.py <input file name> Y

where <input file name> Y is input.txt 2000000 for the actual puzzle data or 
sample.txt 10 for the sample data.

To generate the answer for part 2, run part2.py instead of part1.py and use 
input.txt 4000000 or sample.txt 20, respectively.
