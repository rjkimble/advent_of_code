To generate the answer for part 1, run the following command:

python part1.py <input file name>

where <input file name> is input.txt for the actual puzzle data or sample.txt for the sample data.

To generate the answer for part 2, run part2.py instead of part1.py.

Note: the shortest path algorithm I implemented here is quite efficient, but it
works only in the situation where edges all have the same length, which is the
case here.
